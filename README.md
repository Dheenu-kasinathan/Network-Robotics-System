# Network-Robotics-System

Project - Control Swarm of Robots: 
      Modules - robot.py , run_simulation.py , swarm_simulation.py
      
Goal: The goal is to simulate the control of 6 wheeled robots in PyBullet (a physics simulator) that need to navigate an environment

Topics: Networked Robotics Systems and Swarming

Software: Python

Implementation:
      * Implemented the formation control using relative state based/rigidity based control laws
      * Obtained the desired formations - Square, Traingle, Line
      * The Environment and Obstacles are known
      * Implemented the navigation of robot using Propotional Derivative Control Law
      * Obstacle avoidance is implemented using the potential fields
